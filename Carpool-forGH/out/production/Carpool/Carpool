API Keys:
	Google Maps Geocoding API Key: AIzaSyB7TaYb8qpe8TLAB658Lwm2h8rFwlWlpgc
	Google Maps Distance Matrix API Key: AIzaSyBe7kTXcUXNoll_Q29vrUkFcCLs-ZmiG5Y

Student
	int carCapacity - how many cars their car can hold

Edges
	arrivalTime - weight between 0 and 30, 0 means they are totally incompatible, 30 means they arrive at the same time

	departureTime - weight between 0 and 30, 0 means they are totally incompatible, 30 means they leave at the same time

	Distance - weight between 0 and 100, 0 meaning they are too far apart, 100 meaning they live together

	Limit a students edges with the size of their car
	

Algorithm
	The algorithm should prioritize size of groups (bigger is better) and strength of weights (bigger is better) to pick group
